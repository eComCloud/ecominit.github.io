eComInit - service resource manager
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
eComInit is a framework for the management of a system and its resources. It is
  modular in design and its component parts coordinate to track and manage
  resources.
<p class="Pp">An <i>instance</i> is the fundamental unit of eComInit. These are
    individual resources which are either a) directly managed by or b) monitored
    by eComInit. Instances are composed of <i>properties</i> which describe the
    characteristics and status of that resource.</p>
<p class="Pp">All instances have a parent <i>class</i>. A class also has
    <i>properties</i>. Instances inherit the properties of their class, but can
    override these.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Naming"><a class="permalink" href="#Naming">Naming</a></h2>
All <i>classes</i> and <i>instances</i> have a name. A class is named in reverse
  domain name notation. For example, here is a class name:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>io.eComCloud.eci.repository</b></div>
<p class="Pp">An <i>instance</i> has its own name within the class. The instance
    is then referred to from outwith the class by a <i>System Resource
    Identifier</i>, or <b>SRI</b>. An SRI always refers to an instance. It is
    composed of a <i>class name</i>, followed by a colon, followed by an
    <i>instance name</i>. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>io.eComCloud.eci.repository:default</b></div>
<p class="Pp">If no instance name is specified, then the instance named
    <b>default</b> is referred to by default. Thus merely
    <b>io.eComCloud.eci.repository</b> is also equivalent to the above SRI.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Dependencies"><a class="permalink" href="#Dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
A <i>dependency</i> is a kind of <i>property</i>. An instance which specifies a
  dependency is called a <i>consumer</i> of that dependency. The dependency
  specifies a <i>citee</i> instance on whose status the startup of the consumer
  is conditioned, and optionally also whose events may trigger the consumer's
  automatic restart and stop. An instance remains in the offline state until all
  its dependencies are satisfied.
<p class="Pp">Dependencies are regarded as satisfied or not according to the
    particular semantic of its <i>kind</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<table class="tbl">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Requires</b></td>
    <td>The cited instance must be online or degraded.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Optional</b></td>
    <td>The cited instance must be either be online or degraded, or it must be
      in an unsatisfiable state, e.g. because it eci.startd 8 has failed, is
      disabled, is incomplete, or any of this applies to any of its
      dependencies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Conflicts</b></td>
    <td>The cited instance must be disabled, maintained, or not present.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">Dependencies also denote conditions under which the consumer will
    be automatically restarted in response to events that occurred to the citee.
    There are four such <i>restart conditions</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<table class="tbl">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Never</b></td>
    <td>There are no conditions under which the restart of the citee will cause
      the consumer to be restarted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>On-Error</b></td>
    <td>The consumer will be restarted if the citee restarts due to an
      error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>On-Restart</b></td>
    <td>The consumer will be restarted if the citee restarts for any
      reason.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>On-Refresh</b></td>
    <td>The consumer will be restarted if the citee is refreshed, or if it
      restarts for any reason.</td>
  </tr>
