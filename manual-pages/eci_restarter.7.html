Instances in an eComInit system each belong to a restarter, by default this is
  the default restarter which is part of <b>svc.startd(8)</b>. The restarter's
  job is to control the managed instances which have been delegated to it, and
  to report on the status of these as well as any unmanaged resources which it
  tracks. Each restarter is free to interpret the properties of instances which
  have been delegated to it, so semantics varies between restarters, but a
  particular set of properties and reporting conventions is common to them all,
  and is described below.

  DEFINITION</a></h2>
<b>PROPERTIES</b>
<p class="Pp"><b>restarter</b> <i>sri nullable</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of the delegated restarter for this instance. If set
  to <i>null</i> then the instance is not restarted, but is simply consdiered
  online so long as all its dependencies are up. This is not regarded as an
  <i>unmanaged</i> instance, thus it is perfectly possible to invoke
  administrative requests upon it. Any properties marked <i>managed-only</i>,
  however, are unlikely to be of any use.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>startLimitBurst</b> <i>integer managed-only</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum number of start-attempts that may be made within
  <b>startLimitIntervalSec</b> seconds. When this number is reached, the
  instance is transitioned to the <b>Maintenance</b> state.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>startLimitIntervalSec</b> <i>integer managed-only</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">See above.</div>
